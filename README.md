# ELYSSIU
ELYSSIU is an LSU-Inspired Fantasy RPG made by (W)age Gap, otherwise known as Team 3. 

Play as an isekai'ed MC who was summoned into a world where campus seems a bit smaller (and pixelated), comp sci brainrot is realer, and 
JLD is *still* your mentor?! To get back to the real world, you must follow wizard JLD's quests to eventually get rid of the yapper in the town.

We used Unity as our game engine, C# as our programming language, and imported sprites created by our design leads.
